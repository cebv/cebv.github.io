Civic Engagement Beyond Voting  is a small group of women committed to progressive change in Arizona. Our members seek to promote, assist, advise, and collaborate with other groups with the intention of amplifying their voices and strengthening their impact and effectiveness. We focus on Arizona issues and legislative action, seeking to provide useful, actionable and accurate information that leads to direct action and positive change.  CEBV also educates Arizona constituents on how best to effect change in the Arizona legislature using the Request to Speak System (RTS). We register accounts for RTS, educate, support and provide weekly call-to-action updates. To date, we have registered over 1,200 people for RTS.
The Request to Speak system (RTS) is a way for you to weigh in on bills from the comfort of your own home. It's as easy as giving a thumbs up or a thumbs down! More information about the RTS system can be found in the <a href="#Request To Speak System">Request To Speak System section</a></p>

CEBV realized a need for a weekly news round-up of all the Progressive news in Arizona, so we created The Arizona Activist. This weekly email has interviews, reviews of the new and upcoming activist groups, volunteer opportunities throughout the groups, a summary of the weekly progressive success' news, etc. So far, we've featured several groups: Desert Progressives, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, and Indivisible Arizona CD6. <a href="http://us15.campaign-archive2.com/home/?u=c060f172658106bd0be87b72b&id=eb5ea9b499">Click here</a> to sign up for our mailing list!

<hr id="AZ Legislative Update">
<h2>AZ Legislative Update</h2>
<p>Roughly 1,500 bills are introduced in each legislative session.  Melinda Merkel Iyer compiles the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YRyLBVVaWhGj4lFjrvigmll4xvuR5ZCxpQz5V3dZRIM/mobilebasic">Weekly AZ Legislative Update</a>, an easy-to-follow overview of the more notable bills that are active in the Legislature for each week.  She describes each bill in everyday language and explains where it stands in the lawmaking process that week.  Though she does recommend a stance for each bill, she also cites multiple sources and links to news articles so that concerned citizens can make up their own minds.  Access the update through our weekly call-to-action email: <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Feepurl.com%2FcDM6aL&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHc-9u6ASkjRZun9Ioe4qyqL225NQ">Sign up here</a>

<hr id="Request To Speak System">
<h2>Request To Speak System</h2>

<p>The Request To Speak (RTS) system is an online tool that allows the public to voice their opinions on proposed bills in the Arizona State Legislature. The online RTS system allows you to do this from anywhere that you have internet access! It's as easy as giving a thumbs up or a thumbs down! When the committee is in session, the committee members and the public will see the names of everyone who has registered an opinion (supporting, opposing, or neutral) on each proposed bill, who they are representing (an agency, organization, or just themselves as a private citizen), if they wish to speak (when the bill is in committee), and each person’s comments.  This information is also viewable for past committee agendas.</p>

<p>If you want to get signed up for RTS, send your name (as written on your voter registration) and email address to <a href="mailto:rtsaz2017@gmail.com">rtsaz2017@gmail.com</a>, and a volunteer will enter your name into the kiosk for you. You will get an email confirmation of your account and instructions on how to use it.</p>
